Installing pre-compiled binaries
================================

Binary releases of RAT are standalone, and do not require the installation
of other libraries to function correctly. 

The Windows 95/98/NT binary is a self-extracting installer, double-click on
its icon and follow the instructions.

The Unix versions are distributed as tar archives compressed with gzip. The
archive contains documentation files and a binary which can be installed as
follows:
	tar zxvf rat-3.3.0-Linux.tar.gz
	install -m 755 rat /usr/local/bin
replacing "3.3.0-Linux" with the version number and platform of your choice.


Compiling from source code
==========================

To compile RAT from source you MUST download and compile the following
additional packages:
	The UCL common multimedia code library
	The UCL distribution of tcl-8.0
	The UCL distribution of tk-8.0
These can be downloaded from http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/multimedia/software
or, if you have access to the UCL CVS server, you should fetch the modules
common, tcl-8.0 and tk-8.0.

On Windows 95/98/NT you should install the packages in c:\src. The entire
package can be built using Visual C++ 6.0 with the rat.dsw workspace, there
is no need to separately compile common, tcl-8.0 and tk-8.0.  Ensure that
you select the correct configuration when compiling (rat win32 release for 
example). To compile the IPv6 version, you need the Microsoft Research IPv6 
stack; this must be downloaded separately.

On Unix you should build the tcl-8.0, tk-8.0 and common packages before
attempting to compile rat. You should then build rat as follows:
	./configure
	make
The compilation process requires that all four packages are installed below
a common directory. A distribution package can be built with the command
	make tgz
The configure script takes the following options:
	-optimize	build an optimised binary
	-debug		build a binary with debug symbols
	-profile	build a binary with profiling information
	-bounds		compile with array bounds checking (requires a
			modified gcc which supports this)
	-DSYMBOL	define SYMBOL in the C preprocessor
To compile with IPv6 support you should add -DHAVE_IPv6 to the configure
script. This is not supported on all platforms.

If you need to modify the source to build RAT on your platform, please send
these modifications to rat-trap@cs.ucl.ac.uk for incorporation in future
releases.
