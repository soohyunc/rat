Build instructions are given below. The main dependency is on Tcl/Tk which is

This version of RAT was developed with Tcl/Tk8.0p2, earlier versions may not 
work.

Building RAT (UNIX)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Edit the configure script and add your local Tcl/Tk paths.
2. Type "./configure"
3. Type "make"

Look at configure to see the various build options.


Building RAT (WINDOWS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you have a non-standard Tcl/Tk installation (i.e. not in
   Program Files/Tcl), edit the file rat.dsw and change all path
   references of tcl and tk to your local installations.
2. Open rat.dsw from the developer studio.
3. Click Build->Build rat.exe.  

If you are installing against the sources of Tcl/Tk and not the binary
distribution you may have to add tclreg80.lib to your library settings.
