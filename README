The Robust-Audio Tool has been written by Vicky Hardman, Isidor
Kouvelas, Colin Perkins, and Orion Hodson in the Department of
Computer Science, University College London, UK. The work was
supported by projects:  

   - MICE   (Multimedia Conferencing for Europe - an ESPRIT funded project) 
   - ReLaTe (Remote Language Teaching for SuperJANET - a BT/JISC funded project)
   - RAT    (Robust Audio Tool - an EPSRC funded project)

Further information is available on the world-wide-web, please access URL:

Installation:
If you're on a supported platform, type: 
	./Build rat
If you're porting to a new platform, you will wish to modify the Configure
script to generate the appropriate entries in config.h and Makefile.osdep
automatically. It is intended that most (all?) machine dependent stuff 
should be done using this mechanism.
