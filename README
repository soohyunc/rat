Robust-Audio Tool (RAT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Further information, and a list of frequently asked questions (with
answers) is available from http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mice/rat/

Build instructions are given below.  The main dependency is on Tcl/Tk
which is used for the user interface.  This is available from
http://www.sunscript.com/software/download.  This version of RAT was
developed with Tcl/Tk8.0p2, earlier versions may not work.

Building RAT (UNIX)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Edit Makefile.in and add your local tcl/tk paths.

2. Type, ./configure

3. make

Look at configure to see the various build options.

Building RAT (WINDOWS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you have a non-standard tcl/tk installation (i.e. not in
   Program Files/Tcl), edit the file rat.dsw and change all path
   references of tcl and tk to your local installations.

2. Open rat.dsw from the developer studio.

3. Build the tcl2c sub-project.  You only need to do this the first time
   you install the sources. 

4. Next, you build rat, click Build->Build rat.exe.  

If you are installing against the sources of Tcl/Tk and not the binary
distribution you may have to add tclreg80.lib to your library settings.
